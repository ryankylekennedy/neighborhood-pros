# Claude Code Instructions for Neighborhood-Pros

## Project Context

You're working on a web application called "neighborhood-pros" - a platform connecting homeowners with local service providers.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React (in `/src`)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage)
- Testing: Playwright for end-to-end tests
- The developer (Ryan) identifies as non-technical and prefers GUI tools

## Ralph Wiggum Strategy

You have access to `ralph_scratchpad.md` - this is YOUR thinking space.

**Use it liberally:**
- Work through complex problems
- Think out loud about approaches
- Note gotchas and learnings
- Plan before implementing
- Ask yourself questions
- Be messy - this is your scratch paper

**When to use Ralph:**
- Before making significant code changes
- When you're unsure about an approach
- To break down complex tasks
- To think through database schema changes
- To plan testing strategies
- When dealing with Supabase migrations or RLS policies

**You don't need permission** - just use ralph_scratchpad.md whenever you need to think through something. The scratchpad can get messy and disorganized. That's the point. Work it out there, then write clean code.

## Working with the Full Stack

You have autonomy to make changes across:
- **Frontend**: React components, routing, state management
- **Backend**: Supabase database schema, RLS policies, storage buckets
- **Tests**: Playwright end-to-end tests

When making changes:
1. Use Ralph's scratchpad to think through the full-stack implications
2. Consider what database changes are needed
3. Think about RLS policies for security
4. Plan what Playwright tests should verify the changes

## Database Changes

For Supabase schema changes:
- Create migration files in the appropriate location
- Think through RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Consider what storage buckets might be needed
- Use Ralph's scratchpad to plan migrations before writing them

## Testing Philosophy

- Write Playwright tests that verify the full user flow
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify database operations work correctly
- Include proper test data isolation

## Communication Style

Ryan prefers:
- Detailed, non-technical explanations
- GUI-based solutions when possible
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Understanding the "why" behind technical decisions

When you need clarification, ask! But feel empowered to make reasonable decisions and iterate.
